## Feature
- Create Item from '/sniper/unreg'
- Sell Items when Sniper meets conditions

## Process
- ~~Render unregistered items~~
- ~~Modify items and views~~ 
- ~~sell Item now~~
- ~~Refactor codes~~
- sell Item when due to the date
- sell Item when out of either max or min 
- buy Item using money

## Feedback
- what if the button 'SELL NOW!' ocurred error once deleting its item?
- order how many bitcoins you want, not only one bitcoin
- change duration, max, min after creating Item
- Comply with 'Single Responsibility': Sniper-User on sniperController and Item-Sniper on itemController
